        "1. **Distance Metric**: The method used to calculate the distance between instances. Common metrics include Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distances.\n",
        "2. **k**: The number of neighbors to consider when making a prediction. Choosing the right $k$ is crucial for the algorithm's performance.\n",
        "3. **Weighted KNN**: In some variants, closer neighbors have a higher influence on the prediction than more distant ones, often implemented by assigning weights inversely proportional to the distance.\n",

        "2. **Choose the Number of Neighbors (k)**: Select the number of nearest neighbors to consider for making predictions.\n",
        "3. **Distance Calculation**: For a new data point, calculate the distance between this point and all points in the training dataset.\n",
        "4. **Find Nearest Neighbors**: Identify the $k$ points in the training data that are closest to the new point.\n",
